# todo-api
short and simple node api for CRUD ops on a ToDo list


npm run start


no authentication, nothing but simple CRUD, so I can build up from here. 
This is my simplest api, and now I have something to tweak and mess around with.

Now the fun of this is that you works locally on my machine with my local mongo. I also have a mlabs instance. I wonder, why don't I use a database I already have running out on the mlabs, and put this "table" into it?

Then I can build a front end to it. Like for instance, I have a self contained Angular 2 ToDo front-end that stores its own data. But how about re-purposing  that app, and hooking it to this back-end?

Of course, I also need to add users, and the whole authentication thing,
